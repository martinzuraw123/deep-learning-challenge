##Final Analysis and Report on the Neural Network Model

The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier using a deep learning neural network to predict the success rate of applicants for funding from Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization. The provided dataset contains information on over 34,000 organizations, including metadata such as application type, affiliated sector of industry, government organization classification, use case for funding, income classification, funding amount requested, and whether the money was used effectively. The analysis involves preprocessing the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing datasets. The neural network model is then designed, trained, and evaluated to determine its loss and accuracy. Finally, the model is optimized using various methods such as adjusting input data, adding more neurons and hidden layers, using different activation functions, and adjusting the number of epochs. The ultimate goal is to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75% and save the optimized model as an HDF5 file.

In summary, the deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras was able to achieve a predictive accuracy of 74% in classifying the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup based on their features. The model underwent several optimization attempts, including dropping columns, binning categorical variables, adding hidden layers and neurons, and trying different activation functions, among other adjustments. While the target predictive accuracy of 75% was not achieved, it required significant optimization attempts to reach that level.

These models have been shown to be effective in binary classification problems and may be able to achieve a higher accuracy without the need for extensive optimization attempts. Additionally, they can handle both numerical and categorical variables and can handle outliers and imbalanced datasets well, which may be present in this dataset. Therefore, it may be worth exploring these alternative models as a potential solution to the classification problem.
